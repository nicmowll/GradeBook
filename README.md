 GradeBook Assignment
 
 Additions to Program that were not required:
 
 1) I added another class called Print, which just contains methods that print certain menus and messages.
    This made it much easier and more efficient to handle the user interface.
    
 2) For the remove grade action, I added an option for the user to "re-enter" after the action is done to delete another grade
    or if the user mistyped the name, they can re-enter it.
    
 3) I added a method in Assignment Interface and the assignment class files called printCustom() which returns a string containing
    the assignment's unique variable (# of questions, reading, or concept).
    
 4) The user can enter '0' in menu to quit.
