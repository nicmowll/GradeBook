 GradeBook Assignment
 
 Software, where teachers can manage student grades. They can input certain grades for different types of assignments, manage the grades, 
 sort and filter the grades, and delete the grades.
 
 Additions to Program that were not required:
    
 1) I added a method in Assignment Interface and the assignment class files called printCustom() which returns a string containing
    the assignment's unique variable (# of questions, reading, or concept).
    
 2) The user can enter '0' in menu to quit.
